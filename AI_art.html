Verse 1:
It's hard to ignore the problems we face
People getting shot for the color of their race
Systematic oppression, it's a disgrace
They say we're equal, but that's not the case

Police brutality, it's on the news every day
Another innocent life taken away
No justice, no peace, we need change today
We can't keep living in a world so gray

Chorus:
We need to stand up and fight
For what's right
It's time to make a change
And rearrange

Verse 2:
Income inequality, it's a real thing
The rich keep getting richer, while the poor suffer and cling
Minimum wage is not enough to survive
While the top 1% continue to thrive

Education's expensive, it's hard to get ahead
Debt keeps piling up, it's filling us with dread
The American dream, is it dead?
It's time to wake up, and face what's ahead

Chorus:
We need to stand up and fight
For what's right
It's time to make a change
And rearrange

Verse 3:
Climate change is happening, it's not a myth
The world's getting hotter, the ice caps are starting to shift
We need to take action, before it's too late
Reduce our carbon footprint, it's our fate

Homelessness is rising, it's a travesty
We need to help those in need, it's our responsibility
Mental health, it's often overlooked
We need to support each other, it's worth the hook

Chorus:
We need to stand up and fight
For what's right
It's time to make a change
And rearrange

Outro:
We need to come together, and unite
For a future that's bright
Let's make a difference, it's within our might
It's time to shine a light.
